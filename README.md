# Patient Management Program
A program to manage a GP surgery including options for both patients and staff to use.

Patients can check themselves in and check what position they are in the queue. Staff can see what patients are still waiting to be seen and doctors can indicate they are ready to see a patient, check a patient out and indicate they are no longer ready to see a patient.

To compile and execute the program run the following commands substituting in the name that you would like to give the executable.
```shell
$ gcc -o <name of executable> main.c
$ ./<name of executable>
```

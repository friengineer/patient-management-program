# Patient Management Program
A program to manage a GP surgery including options for both patients and staff to use.

Patients can check themselves in and check what position they are in the queue. Staff can see what patients are still waiting to be seen and doctors can indicate they are ready to see a patient, check a patient out and indicate they are no longer ready to see a patient.

To execute once compiled, run `<name of executable>` where it's the name you specified for the executable during compilation.
